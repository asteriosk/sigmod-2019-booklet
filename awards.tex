\section*{SIGMOD Awards}

\subsection*{SIGMOD Test of Time Award}

\award{Privacy integrated queries: an extensible platform for privacy-preserving data analysis}{Frank McSherry (Microsoft Research, Silicon Valley Lab)}

\quot{The awards committee considers this paper a major scholastic contribution
in the way we should handle one of the core challenges in  data management. The paper
has become a landmark reference for research on a privacy preservation in these modern
times geared at automated data analysis with privacy implications.}


\person{Frank McSherry}{Materialize, Inc.}{\textbf{Frank McSherry} is the Chief Scientist at Materialize, Inc., where he works on interactive and incremental data processing. Frank was previously at the Systems Group at ETH Z\"urich where he worked with students on timely and differential dataflow, and even further back at MSR Silicon Valley where he worked on the Naiad project and on Differential Privacy. Frank is perhaps best known for applying his undergraduate education to big data problems.}{images/awards/mcsherry.jpg}

\subsection*{SIGMOD Contribution Award}

The committee reached an unanimous decision to  grant the SIGMOD Contribution Award award to \textbf{Ahmed Elmagarmid}, especially for his dedicated service to the database community in North America and the Middle East, as the founder/editor of Distributed and Parallel Database Journal, and PC for ACM SIGMOD.


\person{Ahmed Elmagarmid}{Qatar Computing Research Institute, HBKU}{\textbf{Ahmed Elmagarmid} is the founding executive director of the Qatar Computing Research Institute and is an Emeritus Professor of Computer Science at Purdue University.
