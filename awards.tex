\awardedpaper{Interventional Fairness: Causal Database Repair for Algorithmic Fairness}{Babak Salimi, Luke Rodriguez, Bill Howe, Dan Suciu}

\vspace{1mm}

\textbf{Abstract.} Fairness is increasingly recognized as a critical component of machine learning systems. However, it is the underlying data on which these systems are trained that often reflect discrimination, suggesting a database repair problem. Existing treatments of fairness rely on statistical correlations that can be fooled by statistical anomalies, such as Simpson's paradox. Proposals for causality-based definitions of fairness can correctly model some of these situations, but they require specification of the underlying causal models. In this paper, we formalize the situation as a database repair problem, proving sufficient conditions for fair classifiers in terms of admissible variables as opposed to a complete causal model. We show that these conditions correctly capture subtle fairness violations. We then use these conditions as the basis for database repair algorithms that provide provable fairness guarantees about classifiers trained on their training labels. We evaluate our algorithms on real data, demonstrating improvement over the state of the art on multiple fairness metrics proposed in the literature while retaining high utility.

\subsection*{PODS Albert O. Mendelzon Test of Time Award}


The ACM PODS Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award is awarded every year to a paper or a small number of papers published in the PODS proceedings ten years prior that had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, or transfer to practice over the intervening decade. After careful consideration and having solicited external nominations and advice, we have selected the following paper as the award winner for 2019:


~\\~
\awardedpaper{A General Datalog-Based Framework for Tractable Query Answering over Ontologies}{Andrea Cali, Georg Gottlob, Thomas Lukasiewicz, PODS 2009}

\vspace{2mm}

\textbf{Abstract.} In this paper, we introduce a family of expressive extensions of Datalog, called Datalog$^\pm$, as a new paradigm for query answering over ontologies. The Datalog$^\pm$ family admits existentially quantified variables in rule heads, and has suitable restrictions to ensure highly efficient ontology querying. We show in particular that Datalog$^\pm$ generalizes the DL-Lite family of tractable description logics, which are the most common tractable ontology languages in the context of the Semantic Web and databases. We also show how stratified negation can be added to Datalog$^\pm$ while keeping ontology querying tractable. Furthermore, the Datalog$^\pm$ family is of interest in its own right and can, moreover, be used in various contexts such as data integration and data exchange.

\vspace{1mm}

\textbf{Citation from the Committee.} \emph{This paper introduces and studies the Datalog$^\pm$ framework for query answering over ontologies, which subsequently became highly influential in both the database and knowledge representation communities. Its main contribution is an in-depth study of the data complexity of Datalog$^\pm$, and several extensions and restrictions tailored to ontologies. The paper identifies a tractable family of Datalog$^\pm$ formalisms, based on linear tuple-generating dependencies, that generalizes description logics of the DL-Lite family. Extensions with keys and stratified negation are also studied. Other technical results of the paper concerning the chase have been fundamental to further developments in the field. The paper received over 450 citations, evidencing its significant impact.}

\awardedpaper{Efficient Logspace Classes for Enumeration, Counting, and Uniform Generation}{Marcelo Arenas, Luis Alberto Croqueviell, Rajesh Jayaram, Cristian Riveros}

~\\~

\textbf{Abstract.} In this work, we study two simple yet general complexity classes, based on logspace Turing machines, which provide a unifying framework for efficient query evaluation in areas like information extraction and graph databases, among others. We investigate the complexity of three fundamental algorithmic problems for these classes: enumeration, counting and uniform generation of solutions, and show that they have several desirable properties in this respect. Both complexity classes are defined in terms of nondeterministic logspace transducers (NL transducers). For the first class, we consider the case of unambiguous NL transducers, and we prove constant delay enumeration, and both counting and uniform generation of solutions in polynomial time. For the second class, we consider unrestricted NL transducers, and we obtain polynomial delay enumeration, approximate counting in polynomial time, and polynomial-time randomized algorithms for uniform generation. More specifically, we show that each problem in this second class admits a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) and a polynomial-time Las Vegas algorithm for uniform generation. Interestingly, the key idea to prove these results is to show that the fundamental problem \#NFA admits an FPRAS, where \#NFA is the problem of counting the number of strings of length n accepted by a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA). While this problem is known to be \#P-complete and, more precisely, SpanL-complete, it was open whether this problem admits an FPRAS. In this work, we solve this open problem, and obtain as a welcome corollary that every function in SpanL admits an FPRAS.

\awardedpaper{On the Enumeration Complexity of Unions of Conjunctive Queries}{Nofar Carmeli, Markus Kr\"{o}ll}


~\\~

\textbf{Abstract.} We study the enumeration complexity of Unions of Conjunctive Queries (UCQs). We aim to identify the UCQs that are tractable in the sense that the answer tuples can be enumerated with a linear preprocessing phase and a constant delay between every successive tuples. It has been established that, in the absence of self joins and under conventional complexity assumptions, the CQs that admit such an evaluation are precisely the free-connex ones. A union of tractable CQs is always tractable. We generalize the notion of free-connexity from CQs to UCQs, thus showing that some unions containing intractable CQs are, in fact, tractable. Interestingly, some unions consisting of only intractable CQs are tractable too. The question of a finding a full characterization of the tractability of UCQs remains open. Nevertheless, we prove that for several classes of queries, free-connexity fully captures the tractable UCQs.

\vspace{-1mm}

\textbf{Abstract.} What happens when we replace — or augment — human decision-making with algorithms? This is a simple question, but the answers now define a new field of study — a field that I call algorithmic fairness, and that spans issues of fairness, discrimination, accountability, transparency, interpretability and responsibility, and so much more. While some of the early work in the area came out of data mining and machine learning, the field is now truly transdisciplinary, with contributions from all across computer science, as well as from all disciplines that touch on aspects of society - whether it be economics, philosophy, sociology, political science, or communication. In this tutorial, I’ll try to do three things: I'll survey the main questions and some of the key insights we’ve developed over the years. I'll explain the web of connections between the technical and the social disciplines that make up this area, and I'll point to exciting directions that remain to be explored in both technical and social dimensions. Along the way I hope to illustrate what I think are some interesting ``collisions'' between computer science and the social sciences, and call for a reimagining of core ideas in our field, including the very idea of how we think about data representation.
