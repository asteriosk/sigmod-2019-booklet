% Google's software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We're looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Googleâ€™s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to tackle new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.

 

% As a Software Engineer working on Google's infrastructure, you have the opportunity to work on everything from the core platform that runs the world's largest distributed network to redefining the systems that allow applications and services to provide useful information to billions of users around the globe. From our Data Center software groups to Google's Cloud Platform, Gmail to YouTube, our infrastructure engineers across departments wrestle with the vast scale of a ubiquitous system, its products, and services and revolutionize industry leading technologies to handle the sheer magnitude at which Google operates.
