\section*{Welcome Message}

VLDB is a premier annual international forum for data management
and database researchers, vendors, practitioners, application developers,
and users. The annual conference consists of a mix of research talks, tutorials,
demonstrations, and workshops. Its topical coverage includes current
issues in data management, database, and information systems research.
Data management and databases remain among the main technological
cornerstones of the applications of the twenty- first century.
With the emergence of Big Data, data-related technologies are becoming
more important than ever before.
VLDB 2017 is taking place at the Technical University of Munich (TUM),
one of Europe's top universities. It is committed to excellence in
research and teaching, interdisciplinary education and the active promotion
of promising young scientists. The university also forges strong links with
companies and scientific institutions across the world.
TUM was one of the first universities in Germany to be named a University of Excellence.
Moreover, TUM regularly ranks among the best European universities in international rankings.
The VLDB conference takes place at TUM's (original) downtown campus whereas most
natural science and technical faculties, such as mechanical engineering,
computer science, mathematics, chemistry, and physics are located at the modern
Garching campus, about 15 km north of Munich.
The VLDB 2017 conference is held as part of TUM's 50 year anniversary of
establishing Computer Science as a scientific discipline in Munich.
Since TUM was founded in 1868 (almost 150 years ago) it contributed significantly
to the conversion of Bavaria from an agricultural to a highly industrialized region
and also to the overall technological progress. 

VLDB 2017 received almost 750 research paper submissions, of which 133 have been accepted
for presentation at the conference.
The conference program also includes 8 ``roll-over'' papers from VLDB 2016, for a total of
141 research papers.
The full conference program also includes 20 papers from the industrial track, 35 research demonstrations,
8 tutorials, and a panel on cross-disciplinary research.
Each day of the conference also features a plenary keynote presentation.
The main conference is flanked by a variety of workshops on topics of particular interest to the community.

The VLDB 2017 technical program reflects the efforts of hundreds of members of the research community
who have prepared papers, demonstrations and presentations for the conference.
It is is also the result of more than a year of work by the conference officers and the PVLDB Review Board.
We're looking forward to an outstanding program, and we hope that you enjoy it!
